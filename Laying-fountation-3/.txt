what is Dom Element
        Dom elements are dom showing html elements

what is React Element?
        const heading = React.createElement("h1",{id:"heading"},"i am h1 tag");

what is jsx?
        jsx is like html syntax
        jsx - HTML - like or XML- like syntax
                JSX => React.createElement => Object => HTMLElement(render)
                const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">This is jsx file</h1> 
        jsx is not HTML is js
        jsx is js syntsx which is easier to create react elements and we can wrire jsx without react i can build huge project with jsx also but jsx make easy for developers so its jsx
        react and jsx are diffrent

        js not understand jsx javscript understand only ES6 mean ECMASCRIPT

        here also parsel doing the job hihihihi
        jsx (transpiled before it reaches the js engine) - PARCEL - Babel
        Babel job is conver or tranpile js to react code

        If u give Atrributes to jsx you have to use CamelCase
        If u are writing multiple lines code then wrap codes in round brackets() bcz babel understand where to start where to end the line code
        (<h1 id="heading1">
        This is jsx file line 1
        </h1>)

        JSX =>Babel transpiles it to React.createElement => Object => HTMLElement(render)

        const heading =  ithil ulla heading aan react element
        (<h1 id="heading1">
        This is jsx file line 1
        </h1>)


what is react compoent? 
        everything is component in react
        if we create  a page there a button is a component header is a component footer is a component a card is a component title is a component input box is a component searchbar is a component everythingis component

There two types of componenet 
        1 - Class based components - OLD way writing code
        2 - Functional componenets - NEW way writing code

        
React compoent
what is react component?
        2 types compoents 
        1 - Class based compoent - OLD - noway days not using
        2 - Functional compoent - NEW - this way using now a days


what is react Functional compoent?
        its just a normal javascript function which is return some jsx elements

        React Functional compoent is a function that reaturn some piece of jsx code element
        A function get return jsx code is a Functional compoent
        jsx is react element

        eg:
            const HeadingComponent = ()=>{
                return <h1> Hello React Functional compoent<h1>
            }

            this code let short bcz single line code

            const HeadingComponent = ()=> <h1> Hello React Functional compoent<h1>;


// React Element        
        const heading = (
                <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                 Hello React Functional compoent
                <h1>
        );


whats diffrent between element and compoent

this is üòÇ element
          const heading = (
                <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                 Hello React Functional compoent
                <h1>
        );

this is üòÇ compoent
          const Heading = ()=> (
                <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                 Hello React Functional compoent
                <h1>
        );

        just a arow function added then componenetüòÇ

imp‚ùó supoose i want to render my heading component in to my root 

        root.render(<HeadingComponent/>);
this is how you wrapped this is how you will render a Functional compoent in to a page
this is the syntax babel understand
this is how render a component
<HeadingComponent/>  is there is a compoent babel understand that 
that's why u write it like this


lets do more

        if there is two compoent
                suppose if i want title compoent render inside the heading component or inside the container how lets do it's verry easy 

                const Title = (
    <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
    Hello React Functional compoent
   </h1>
)(

// React Functional compoent
const HeadingComponent = ()=> (
    <div id="container">
        <Title/> ------------------------------------------here title insided
        <h1>Hello React Functional compoent</h1>;
    </div>
);
    
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<HeadingComponent/>);

                if title inside write all code come replaced here  here hapening babel reading it and jwing all the code 
when we the browser root containg inside  let see there browser html

what is component composission this top write same thats the answer too


now we are using arrow may use normal function ya sure lets arrow function too in Functional component now days mostly use arrow function its clean
function key word is important when there is this keyword or something 

now lets move next topic

this is how component inside componenet what if u have to put element inside a compoent but before that even before that let me tell important superpower of jsx

                                        over here curlybrase write jsx inside the curly braces you can run any piece of javascript expression you can write any javascript code inside this curly paranthsis any javascript code my dear friends
thats why  jsx is mix of html and javascript its beautiful
the super power is if we write curlybrases you can write any javascript inside any javascript expression inside it

You can inject basically inside any code javascript inside the curly paranthsis cool and stuff this such a super power           

now come point how i can put element inside the component

                                                                        <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                                                                        Hello React Functional compoent
                                                                        </h1>
                                                                        )

                                                                        const number = 1000;

                                                                        // React Functional compoent
                                                                        const HeadingComponent = ()=> (
                                                                        <div id="container">
                                                                                {number}
                                                                                {title1} ------------- title element come here every thing will come here
                                                                                <Title/>
                                                                                <h1>Hello React Functional compoent</h1>;
                                                                        </div>
                                                                        );

                                                                        this all are doing babel all are converting to react code lets appreciate babel amazing compiler

ok how we can react element inside a react element 
        its also same way see react element at the end of the day normal varriable                                                                   

        const elem = <span>React element </span> -------- react element

        const title1 = (
                <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                {elem} ----------------------------- now elem present here
                Hello React Functional compoent
                </h1>
                )

we can put react component also 

                const elem = <span>React element </span> -------- react element


                const title1 = (
                <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
                {elem} ----------------------------- now elem present here
                Hello React Functional compoent
                <HeadingComponent/> ------------------- now compoent here
                </h1>
                )


                // React Functional compoent
                const HeadingComponent = ()=> (
                <div id="container">
                        {title1} ------------- title element come here every thing will come here
                        <Title/>
                           <h1>Hello React Functional compoent</h1>;
                        </div>
                        );

heading componet adding time show an error

ReferenceError : cannot access 'HeadingComponent' before initialization

why this error showing 

bcz its all javascript can you use a const varriable before we initialising it noooooo‚ùó
you need to maintain its not react javascript not allowing to do that 
we cant write bottom also it will inifine lop work error 

lets do this render theer element call 



another topic

            // React Functional compoent
                const HeadingComponent = ()=> (
                <div id="container">
                        {title1} ------------- title element come here every thing will come here
                        <Title/>
                        <Title/>
                        <Title/> ------------------lets write this more times
                           <h1>Hello React Functional compoent</h1>;
                        </div>
