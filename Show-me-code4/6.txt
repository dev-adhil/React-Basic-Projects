what is microservice Architucture?

In the micro sevice Architucture we have diffrent services diffrent job 
we have service like backend service 
we have ui services 
we haeve authentication services 
we have service conecting to database 
we have service for sms sending 
we have service for email sending 

there have diffrent services 

this all micro services all are known as microservices
all this service compine from a app

all this microservices depending on users 
this is know seperation of concerns and single resposability of responses
and this is known as seperation of concerns and single responsabilities concerns
every each and every responsibilties have on job no body inter fair on it 
all the backend deloper frontend developer all are single project same repository 
in micro service it will work their independed work on indipentent part

this is what microservice Architucture

how this service interact each other
that this service all interact each other to make whole applications the ui is talk to backend  
all the services talk to each other


and you know we can use diffrent languages ui create js backed java db for pyhon 

no a question
how we can deploy all services ?

to supoose if we have all the services are deployed 


now lets learn 
how connect micro services in react how to talk difrent microservices out side of the world how react application backend to call
this is what to learn today eppisodes

now we going learn now here we use copied dats and  stored array all datas now we going to do calling api in swiggy 

❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

now lets learn two ways fetch datas in api 
there are two approches 
what are the two approches

1 - when our app load when to make api call
supoose our app load as soon as app load one thing what can do is we just make a api call to fetch the data ans when we get data renser to the ui 
what we will do first as soon as our page we can make an api call wait for data came and the we render the ui
supoose the calltake 500mstime waht will happen the page will load our page will wait for 500ms and after 500ms it will render the ui so waht will happen is
you must have to seen open the webpage you sudenly dont see anything  and sudenly as soon as api response it quickly shows sudenly shows tahts is approch one

2 - As soon as page load what wil happen is we wil just render the ui we  will quickly render it now we will do after quickly add now we will call api call
as soon as get the result back from api now we will rerender the new data we render api from data application 

as soon as the page load made an api callwe wait for data come as soon as data come it will render it 

another approch is as soon as the page load it will quickly render waht ever we render waht ever we have we just rnder the skelton as soo as the 
skeliton as soon as skeliton renders   now we will call an api call as soon as the api and as soon as api call we will just render the data on the web page


in react 2nd approch we will always using 
why we using 2nd this is beter approch this is give better ui bcz in the initial approch 500ms we pages slike kind of we dont do any after 500ms after suddenly we will see thats a poor ui 


now we learned 2nd approch so lets do 

i gona teach you importent topic useEffect()❗❗❗❗❗❗

useEffect hook its a normal react hook just like useState

i want ask a question
whats hook ?
in hook simple term in react whats hook in react i told you last time hook is nothing over complecated stuff no more hook is nothing just js normal function
a normal javascript function which is react give to us its own specific use case this functions just like use state use like state varriable
useEffect has on specific purpose function and lets see whats the purpose of useEffect

useEffect also import like named function 

how can use useEffect let me first tell you this syntax of useEffect 

    useEffect a function lets call like a function and

        useEffect()

    useEffect will take two arguments
        1 - argument is arrow function - callback functional
        2 - argument is dependencies array

        useEffect(()=>{},[])

        lets do console.log in use useEffect

        useEffect(()=>{
            console.log("use effect called")
        },[])

        my question is useEffect() callbackback function called

        the answer is the callback function will be after your component renders 

        when the body component render it will load it will render the component as well the render component finish it will call the callback function 
        which is passed to you 

        when the body component render it will quickly call callback function and useEffect inside printed on screen ot happen inside

        this is how useEffect work 

        if u want after render component you have write useEffect()
        this is the purpose of useEffect❗❗❗❗📍📍📍

        useEffect(()=>{
            console.log("use effect rendered")
            },[])

            console.log("body render ")
        which one first its body after render then call useEffect

        so we come point 

        load page then render api call 

        now render the page now fetch the data  were we fetch data  we will fetch data inside useEffect()
        useEffect(()=>{
            fetchData()
            },[])


        now i will write fetch data logic 
        so how we will fetch data in javascript exact same here too there is nothing difrent how we do it 

        const fetchData = ()=>{
            const data = fetch()
        }

        fetch is super power given by browsers to js engine have 

        this fetch will fetch data from the api what api we want call we want call swiggy api

        can i use swiggy api lets try 

        lets check work or not

        what will fetch return fetch will rwturn a promise how we will resolve promise we can use traditional way .then resolving the promise .then
        .then and catch handling the errors and all 📍❗❗

        insted what i will do is i will follow new approch async await eathen .then catch all then that or you can use async await

        i will advice to use async await standerd practice in industry its much good syntax better syntax right so i am writing async await ❗❗❗

        make the function async and data will come to await

        const fetchData = async () =>{
        const data =await fetch("https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=9.9890092&lng=76.284491&collection=83639&tags=layout_CCS_Biryani&sortBy=&filters=&type=rcv2&offset=0&page_type=null")
        }

        this will resolve the promise and now once we have dataa 

        we have to convert data to json
        to readable form to json

        how we will do again await to resole and i will convert this data in to json() ❗❗❗❗

        const json = await data.json();

        so now we got data json
        lets check call this api from our app
        see wheather this app console or not we can see a load of error

        can we call swiggy api from our app its a huge blocker 

        lets see error:
                        Access to fetch at 'https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=9.9890092&lng=76.284491&collection=83639&tags=layout_CCS_Biryani&sortBy=&filters=&type=rcv2&offset=0&page_type=null' 
                        from origin 'http://localhost:1234' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

        whats this error mean 

        whats CORS policy ?❗❗❗
        basically calling swiggy.com local host has been blocked due to cors policy 
        whats cors policy basically who is blocking us answer our browsers block us to call api from one orgin to diffrent orgin
        our browser not allowing to call swiggy api from local host from one origin to another origin 
        if there is origin missmatch the browser block the api call thats cors policy and 
        go and watch mmy yt channel cors video

        for now how we can bypass this cors there is a way get red the cors 
        so now what we do  just go cors core extention and find browser extention tahts allo you to by pass cors
        this extention help bypasss cors error

        now we got 
        now we add this api data populate our page we have talk to external world this is core part i made an api get inside our app

        now when we got data now we want to  render our page with this new data how do render page with new data i dont want hardcoded case 
        i want new data inside our app 

        first of all see how render all the card

        you remember we did map listOfResturent,map and this listOfResturent contaon res list resList on moc data

        now change and call data live api 
          setListOfResturent(json.data?.cards?.[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants)

        useEffect(()=>{
  fetchData()
},[])

const fetchData = async () =>{
  const data = await fetch("https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/restaurants/list/v5?lat=22.51800&lng=88.38320&is-seo-homepage-enabled=true&page_type=DESKTOP_WEB_LISTING"
  );
  const json = await data.json()

  console.log(json)
  setListOfResturent(json.data?.cards?.[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants)
}

no we got live data
so now we remove moc data
let me dlt file also 

now let me tell important thing 
  setListOfResturent(json.data.cards.[4].card.card.gridElements.infoWithStyle.restaurants)

  lets do this in optional chaining 
    setListOfResturent(json.data?.cards?.[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants)
this good way handling data❗❗❗❗❗❗

lets come

if we page render just small sec blank page body rendered and the page was rendered verry fast

so now how we can improve experince more
meanwhile some time take while load how we improve the experince

what we do as soon as load page time show spin loader i can show spinning loader 
how will show spinning loader let me just tell you how so what will do is unless we have data 
what we will do i want show a spinning loaer over here right so what we do i will write a condition write if if my listOfResturent empty 
supoose we dont have any data what should i do instead of this rendering this all i will render what a loading screen isnt it 
so let me write the logic where we will write logic get this down 

if(listOfResturent.lenght == 0 ) {
    return <h1>Loading.....<>
}

see this loading is showing 

this spinning practice is good way 
noo the good way in industry i will teach you 

today in the industry in the ui world you know what happends concept known as Shimmer UI or conditional rendering 📍📍❗❗❗❗❗

what is Shimmer UI?
A shimmer ui resembles the pages actual ui, so user will under stand 
so quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has show up

its kind of like we load fake page until we get actual data from api the sound complex its not instead loading showing 

so lets create shemmer ui shimmer component

create  a new file shimmer.js create a component

this is also known as conditional rendering 

if u have condition and rendering its called conditional rendering❗❗❗
if(listOfResturent.lenght == 0 ) { ---------- here a condition
    return <h1>Loading.....<>
}

now we writing if condition inside reture so two two return we can do single return inside body

we can do this way too return listOfResturent.length == 0 ? <Shimmer/> : (..............)

here we use ternery operation to handle this condition 

this type code see dont worry just think this is a turnery option this  is render based on condition it render 
this condition full fill sahmmer will render its not full fill then then bottom code render 
this was conditional rendering 


now we going learn login logout button if we click login button then change logout button 

lets create a button in header
as soon as click login button i want to show it logout button how i do that

          <button className="login">Login</button>
i want this code dynamic this is jsx this is jsx button i want this login keyword to be dynamic it should change logout how can i do that in react 
now to do this 

we can create a local varriable and we can say btnName = Login 
so initially this is string you alredy know if we have a string i want display string inside the jsx how would i used this
how i would use this varriable in jsx how will use use that we put up the {} curly braces write btnName over here {btnName} now its login now isnt it
and now see login we some how want to change in to logout so basically its simple logic right look simple what will do on click of the button i will write
onclick on the button i will change btn name to logout it should worl isnt it 
understand very well
if click button it change name to logout and if i click once again back to login 
so what i am doing is initially by default button login but a soon as as click we have click handler we have call back function we click function
i want to change my button name so  what i do  onClick={()=>{btnName = "Logout"}} isnt it now this const varriable make let bcz doesnot modify const varriables
now i have change this do you think this will work there is normal js varriable react react showing screem do you think this will work
 if i click this will it change logout bcz will btn name is updted will update logout
 
 lets check huh

 nothing happened why 
 if u think the buton function not work lets console lets check yes console work then why not  login to logout in console logou working 
 but why the ui logout did not working there is minute concept verry importent❗❗❗❗❗

 we have btn name its an normal javascript varriable const btnName = "Login" and we used like inside jsx {btnName} this login come over here
 login in here button but as soon click on the buton i want be {btnName} want to update btn name got updated alredy so console loged right
 updated to logout but the ui did not render but are component this did not have refresh there would be 
 some way that refresh the header component that can take latest right it can take latest value of btnName isnt it they could be some refresh kind of thing 
 so this is why javascript varriable doesnot work such cases if u  want to make your component dynamic
 if you want something should change in your component we use local state varriables here is where use state state varriables comes in to picture
 this is why we use state varriables ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗
 now when we create supoose we have created btn name a special react varriable that local state varriable lets create it
 how would be use state 
 where does come use state its come from named import from react how we create useState 
 
 const [btnNameReact,setNameReact] = useState("Login")

 this behave normal javascript varriable but its a special react varriable special local varriable why its special i will tell you while 
 insted of btn name supoose i use btnNameReact   const [btnNameReact] = useState("Login")
 let me save go back now thw login coming from btnNameReact  
 now onClick on the buton i want to update this new state varriable can i write this 
             const [btnNameReact,setNameReact] = useState("Login")
           <button className="login" onClick={()=>{btnNameReact ("Logout")}}>{btnName}</button> btnNameReact btnNameReact ("Logout")
no noo u cant directly modify  but you have use the second parrameter setstate 
use state is giving us a varriable and also gives you a function which will update you ta\hats second argument put set from name anything 
you cant directlu update setstae use for update :
          <button className="login" onClick={()=>{setNameReact ("Logout")}}>{btnNameReact}</button>
ok now what will happen

so if we use let btnName = 

if we use this in react wheather not know value updaedor not react not know anything 
state this so now when this update when ever you updated how we will update we will update setstate the react will triger render once again 
basically react will what do 
when ever your state varriable cahnges setstate react will rerender header componentreact will kind of refresh header component all the updated values there
when do onclick this will setbtnreact the btnnamereact will become logout and it will just refresh header component 
lets see working 
ya working how
bcz as soon as clicked on button react updated the btnNameReact varriable and also refreshheaer component it triger reconcilation cycle 

what u mean rendering a component ?
it mean call the header function or call the header component once again it will triger once again

const [btnNameReact,setNameReact] = useState("Login")
the use state using const then how changing values how we can modifying varriables ask you friends 
bcz the render afer setstae the rerender that time the state is new varriable created new variable hehehehehehehe❗❗❗

now we putting toogle functionality ❗❗❗❗
login to logout and logout to login 
put a condition if my button name is alredy login right if my buton name == "login" then only change logout othervise change in to login once again


Lets Build Search functionality ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

in search bar if what we write it will display

let create search bar top of the restaurants
create input and search button 
        <div className="search">
          <input type="text" placeholder="Search Resturent" className="search-input" />
          <button >Search</button>
        </div>

To get the from input box we nee to take this value of seach input box and i have to bind this in to a local state varriable
to track the value of input box to get the value i have bind this value with the local state varriable

i want to create one more state varriable and i will bind that varriable

const [seachText, setSerchText] = useState("")

now i want to bind serch text in to my input box 
how we can bind 

we use a proper jsx syntax 
          <input type="text" placeholder="Search Resturent" className="search-input" value={searchText} />
we added a value added state name there

now what will happens is now search text is over here value={searchText}  and when i click this button
i want my search text just console log search text 

now showing error we cant type anything our input box not taking anything nothing over here 

why so? ❗❗❗❗❗

this is very importent concept❗❗❗❗❗

why this is not working why input box not working 

how to fix this 

why let me tell you 

we have given value we have bind this values in text over here and the searchText over here value={searchText} its bind to the inpu box
that means what ever theire inside searchText varriable will be value of variable  inside input box 
now 
when i cahnge the value of inputbox changingit the value of input box till tide to the search text 
so my seachText variable not get updation but i am trying modify input box it cant happen
so becuse  this value is bind y=to the search text and the seach text is empty so this input box not change 
unless we change searchText variable
 so thats why fix this what we will do is ❗❗❗❗

 write onChange handler here as soon as input changes this input tag changes what happen my onChange function should also change my searchText variable
 this onChange function will update my function how we do update my search text update with the new value 
 first of all how will i get new value 
 i will get from the callback method this is a e normal callback method like normal click handler normal onChange handler e is a event 
 what we will do is we will setSerchText variable here the value give  e.target.value setSerchText(e.target.value)  
 now what will happed lets see 
              <input type="text"   className="search-box" value={searchText}  onChange={e => setSearchText(e.target.value)}/>

    in this input box its tide  value is tide to seachText when ever we type something when even changing in input box 
    we want to update my search text 
    this is how update our search text it will show the value over here

if i do onChange now if i try to print this value search text value it will print the value console over there 

let me repeat once more 
if u writing time calling on change method 
onChange method taking the target value and it just updating the state varriable and the the body component refreshing but the best part is 
react is trigering the reconsilation it finding the diffrence between oldr dom and new virtual dom
so the react is finding the diffrence between older virtual dom 

the virtual dom is object representation jsx 
what react is doing the react is rerendering the body component but it only updating input value inside the dom 
dom manipulation is very expensive react is verry efficient in doing when ever i writing anything 
something react exactly knows checking the diffrence every hiting the key press react is finding the diffrence the two virtual doms 
and its updating only the input box react is presisly know only the inpu has changed from older version of virual dom to newer version of virtual doms
once it find difrence now its updating that inside the dom only the input box thast how efficient react 

each tme we input writing onChange working so body rendering


now what we do serching getting dats ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

just two line 

lets work this 

now we have onclick as soon as onclick now i want to write filter logic and i want to update my UI

how update my ui tahts simple right 

l will just update listOfResturent waht will happen as soon as i will update listOfResturent 
as soon as my listOfResturent variable change what happen 
//whenever state variable update, react triggers a reconcilation cycle(re-render the component)

so when ever my list of component change my ui component automatically ge update 
my only job is as a developer react developer is so each write two line so easy bu behind scn lot of happen

so what now we have to do is 

now we want list filter out

what i will do is i will do a filter array do filter 
watch map filter reduce filter in javascript

 listOfResturent.filter(()=>{})

 filter function then callback this callback function itrate all the listOfResturent

 the the data in listOfResturent have
 and what will happpends is i will filter out how will filterout the res

    listOfResturent.filter((res)=>res.data.name)

now we will give filteredResturent

const filteredResturent =  listOfResturent.filter((res)=>res.data.name)

now we got filteredResturent over here

now what we do now we update UI using filteredResturent

insted showing listOfResturent now i need filteredResturent

what should i do should update listOfResturent from here

lets update listOfResturent over here

setListOfResturent()

now listOfResturent updated with this filteredResturent

setListOfResturent(filteredResturent);

now what will happends is it will when i click on the button filteredResturent and it will update the variable and when it update the variable  
it will triger reconcilation process the body component will render and it will  rerender the updated value so listOfResturent will cahnge

now not working

            const filteredResturent =  listOfResturent.filter(
              (res) => res.data.name === searchText
            );

bcz only equal value we need included values 
i would this name will includes the search text

            const filteredResturent =  listOfResturent.filter(
              (res) => res.data.name.includes(searchText)
              // (res) => res.info.name.includes(searchText)
            );

now see working 

the working 

now lets see html working when u click on it 

lets expalin

when i click this it will find out filter out all all the Resturents which one includes 
and just updating listOfResturent variable with data and what will happend is soon as listOfResturent will be updated when ever the state variable updated
it will rerender the body component it will rerender my body component it time render the filtered data this time rerender the filtered data


❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗


if the user try to search for some small letters difrence so we will take care of this

i wil convert both of them lower case what ever
i have mathching before i am checking this is common problem 

just write .tolowercase before you finding it and then even the serach text what ever random search 
now check done

 const filteredResturent =  listOfResturent.filter(
              (res) => res.data.name.includes(searchText)
               res.info.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase()) 
               );



now look fi\ull code of this 

          <input type="text"   className="search-box" value={searchText}  onChange={e => setSearchText(e.target.value)}/>
          <button 
            onClick={()=>{
              // Filter the restaurent card and update the UI 
              //Search Text
              console.log(searchText)

            const filteredResturent =  listOfResturent.filter((res) =>
               res.info.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase())
            );

              
              setListOfResturent(filteredResturent);

            }}>Search



now also search have a buf if we write otherthing anything then not run bug 
if type without any related data bug lagg every  thing is gone
just broken our code what happen to this ❗❗❗❗❗

how do you alredy know anwer 
so whenever  we are dioing a filter one time supoose if i search cofee oevr here search  box we got restaurants cards what we have done is 
we have updated our listOfResturent and now whenever we searching once again you searching this two restaurants not the whole restaurants cards 
we have modified our of  listOfResturent this andwe have all the restaurantsof their which data from api we lost the data and we have updated new data
now this listOfResturent filter only cofee serched data is this functionality good noo 
actually we want seconnd time all time we need filter all the restaurants which they from api call so thats the bug 
how we solve this

so what we are doing is the mistake over here the bug is indroduce bcz we are just updating listOfResturent              
                 setListOfResturent(filteredResturent); this line
with filtered list  just modifying the original stff instead what we should is we want to modify this we keep another copy of filtered list 
a simple solution this  we will keep all the  listOfResturent and what i do is 
i wil create another state variable for filter only the filtered restaurants and setfilterdresturent and initially null
and now when ever we do filter instead of updating listOfResturent i will just update setfilterdresturent 
                      setFilteredResturent(filteredResturent);

and now when i rendering i will render it from filteredResturent 
basically i kept a copy all the restaurants and my filteredResturent 
so now i will apply filter and when i will filter when ever while i will calculating i will filtering i would need listOfResturent
the listOfResturent inderect when i modify list of restaurants never modifying listOfResturent
i only modify when ever data get from api

              <input type="text"   className="search-box" value={searchText}  onChange={e => setSearchText(e.target.value)}/>
          <button 
            onClick={()=>{
              // Filter the restaurent card and update the UI 
              //Search Text
              console.log(searchText)

            const filteredResturent =  listOfResturent.filter((res) =>
               res.info.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase())
            );

              
              setFilteredResturent(filteredResturent);

            }}>Search

          </button>



      <div className="res-container">
        {filteredResturent.map((retaurent, index) => (
          <RestaurentCard key={index} resData={retaurent} />
        ))}
      </div>


now we reaload our page not show anything why 

bcz the problem is we have not updated filred restaurants filteredResturent is still empty 
so initially i wil update 

when we fetching data i am updating  a copy of listOfResturent as well as filteredResturent with what ever data i have got 
the data i have got i am updating this both of the state variable this 
  setFilteredResturent(json.data?.cards?.[4]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants)

so now see this when the body component load first time it makes an api call and it update the listOfResturent aa s well as the filteredResturent
and now i will use this listOfResturent indirect when i have filter something it will ust use it will filter put and i will update my filteredResturent
and to display to display it Ui using filteredResturent

            const filteredResturent =  listOfResturent.filter((res) =>
               res.info.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase())
            );

lets explain 

when i click filterd filteredResturent updated and becuseand when ever a state variable cahnges it automatically refreshes so filred restaurants
displaying the restaurantswith the filterd restaurant
the filteredResturent is now geting displayed waht is the value inside filteredResturent data has coming from api so next time i will filter 
it will filter from listOfResturent
