we are make our app dynamic

now our task is clicking  a button show morethan 4 rating resturents

supoose we click button top rated resturent list the resturent
 how will we do this

 first we need to know click handlers event handlers onclick event

 what we do

 we can do when we have button do something onclick i have to do onclick what  do is in this button i will pass an atribute 
 i will pass an atribute that atribute known as onclick and then onclick take a call back function onclick = (()=>{}) this is the function call on onclick
onclick you can write in button onclick  waht ever you will pass the function is a call back function it will be called after onclick 

lets show: 
        <button className="filter-btn" onClick={()=>{console.log("button clicked )}}>Top Rated Restaurant</button>


now we going discuss importent thing  📍📍❗❗❗❗❗

first think how this cards comming over here 
this card are coming from resList there is the data in the resList the resList have some mocdata inside it

so what i want to do just three resturent over here so what should i do just change ths resturent list and my web page will change

what ever resturent list will change everything will change

how are this cards will generated
the cards will listed bcz of resList
anything will change resturent list  are webpage will change

thats is basics of dynamisam

lets do

firstof all not use resList lets not use mocdata 
let me tech from the basics  bcz this is importent concept❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

if we did not resturentlist lets create our own Restaurant list 

const listOfResturent = []

the listOfResturent is empty list 
now let me go let me power my ui by listOfResturent what i did is clearly see i am not using any moc data 
lets learn from basics its importent❗❗❗❗❗

this life lesson❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗

const listOfResturent = []
 thsi empty now i am trying loop this this empty list over  here 
 supoose i have one resturent over here :
                                        //Normal javascript varriable 
                                        const listOfResturent = [  
                                                                    {info: {
                                                                    id: "783524",
                                                                    name: "KFC",
                                                                    cloudinaryImageId:
                                                                        "RX_THUMBNAIL/IMAGES/VENDOR/2024/12/9/390c3201-733d-457c-b591-b6f70ae38302_783524.JPG",
                                                                    costForTwo: "₹400 for two",
                                                                    cuisines: ["Burgers", "Fast Food", "Rolls & Wraps"],
                                                                    avgRating: 4.5,
                                                                    parentId: "116758",
                                                                        deliveryTime: 24,
                                                                }}]
                                        what we need render this card we need url

if i give one resturent data so there show only show one resturent data if i adding anothe so show only 2 cards

so what i do is onclick of the button i have to do something over here so that so i can only filter out top rated resturent
basicall i have some how write a filter logic over here :
            <button className="filter-btn" onClick={()=>{
            //Filter logic here
            
            }}>
            Top Rated Restaurant</button>

    on click of here i need to filter out something what i need to filterout  i need to modify how getting ui is generated listof resturent
    if my list of resturent 2 resturent my ui will list two resturent suppose listOfResturent modify 1 resturent to filter 1 resturent 
    what will happen ui will automatically show right so what i have to do i have filter logic over here
    and i have change myresturent just have 1 resturent so what i can do 

            <button className="filter-btn" onClick={()=>{
            //Filter logic here
                listOfResturent = listOfResturent.filter((res)=>res.info.avgRating>4)
                console.log(listOfResturent)
            }}>
                Top Rated Restaurant</button>
      </div>

    that filterout all resturent it will update my resturent 

now ui is not updated how ui can updated

basically ideally dont you think over here listOfResturent.map this listOfResturent if listOfResturent changes automatically :
                                                                                                                                <div className="res-container">
                                                                                                                                    {listOfResturent.map((retaurent, index) => (
                                                                                                                                    <RestaurentCard key={index} resData={retaurent} />
                                                                                                                                    ))}
                                                                                                                                </div>

                                                                                                                                this should have refress 

                                                                                                                                if i am clicking that button my list of resturent earlier have 
                                                                                                                                my list resturent earlier have 4 objects in console 
                                                                                                                                if i click on butto now only 2
                                                                                                                                so automatically my page have refresshed how cool wold be insted of writing logic
                                                                                                                                this is super power react 📍📍❗❗❗❗❗
                                                                                                                                react have supper power dom manipulation this is the exact problem react solved
                                                                                                                                supoose if u have to keep your data the ui layer constintly each other thats were react come to the picture
                                                                                                                                all langues trying to solve this if my data changes ui changes  so this is the thing all frame work trying to solve
                                                                                                                                fast dom manipulation
the listOfResturent is normal javascript let varriable but if you give listOfResturent super power of react it will super energetic react varriable
and its a normal javascript now i want to create super powerful react varriable and we also called state varriable so basicall it is like state va\
// state varriable - super powerful varriable how we give this state varriable to super powerful varriable 
how do create super powerful varriable 
let me show
for that react use Hooks 📍📍❗❗❗❗❗ 
for that react use which is known as use state this is introduction Hooks❗❗❗❗ 
what is react hook?📍📍❗❗❗❗❗
the react Hook is normal react javascript function. which is given to us its a prebuild the only thing is that function comes with super power
that function some logic return behind the scn inside react that function is a  utilty function react to us all are there multiple al are known as react Hooks



this are most important hook 99% wrking this

how do you use it we will have import this utilities functions there are multiple react Hooks just understand its javascript normal Hook

first you understand its a react hook firstof all make simple react is very simple its a normal javascript utility function there are two react hook 


# React Hook
(Normal react utilty function - )           -------where weget utility function when we get node modules
- useState() - super powerful state varriable in react
- useEffect() - 

useState() how get this first import its named import
import { useState } from "react" like this

import React from "react" ---------- how this working
how import is working somebody exported the react this react coming from node_modules that we able to import 
same thing named import somebody have exported this state varriables so we can import

when we talk hook its the utility function the first utility function learning its useState how do you use state 
state varriable 
when i say state varriable why would call state varriable bcz it maintain state of  component  i am creating local state varriable inside body
lets call local state varriable the local state varriable scope inside the functional component ❗❗📍

how do you create functional component 📍📍❗❗❗❗❗

const[listOfResturent] = useState();

when ever you call useState it will give you the state varriable 
how do you recive state varriable like this inside an array const[listOfResturent] = useState(); this how create a state varriable

its a super power varriable

//Local State Varriable - Super powerful varriable
const[listOfResturent] = useState();

//Normal javascript varriable
let listOfResturent; 

supoose Normal javascript varriable we give initial time a array let listOfResturent = []
simmilerly local state varriable we give const[listOfResturent] = useState([]); an array for default value 
so what ever we pass inside array it become default value of varriable 
we have listOfResturent so we have const[listOfResturent] this is a state varriable in react how do you created how do you pass default value 
useState([]) over here 

supoose we give default value null in Normal js varriable listOfResturent = null
in local state varriable const[listOfResturent] = useState(null);

supoose we give default value one resturent i can give data of resturent
    const[listOfResturent] = useState([{
        data:resturent
        {
            dfghjkl
            gshjk
        }
    }]);


how we can modify listOfResturent i cannot do something like this
listOfResturent = [] this not valid i cannot modify how i can modify it by  a function   the function come by second parrameter of array
this is known as setlistOfResturent  basicall name have waht ever you wish too 
but the prefered convention in the industry if the name is listOfResturent put it setlistOfResturent if the name is res set it setres basically play set before it
its not manditory its normaly convention in industry pls try this

const[listOfResturent, setlistOfResturent] = useState([]); the setlistOfResturent is update list you have update the list 

supoose if i click button i want to update listOfResturent i cannot do listOfResturent equal to  
            <button className="filter-btn" onClick={()=>{
            //Filter logic here
                listOfResturent = listOfResturent.filter((res)=>res.info.avgRating>4)
                console.log(listOfResturent)
            }}>

listOfResturent =  this not a proper way to update 
how update my state varriable is i will call setlistOfResturent and pass in the new data which i want to push inside 
what i want push inside first 
call the setlistOfResturent() function and pass in the data push in to the new data i want push inside 

so what i want to push inside it  firstofall let it make empty 
firstof click on the button let pass what we will pass supose click on the button
so what ever data we need to 
supoose we want update this varriable i will use setlistOfResturent of now i will pass data which will new we push inside of listOfResturent 
what i need push inside listOfResturent i need to basicall filter the listOfResturent

        <button className="filter-btn" onClick={()=>{
            //Filter logic here
                filterdList = listOfResturent.filter((res)=>res.info.avgRating>4);
                console.log(listOfResturent)
                setListOfResturent(filterdList)
            }}>

basically i am updating listOfResturent using filteredlist

lets explain well

you can create an normal varriable like 
const list = []
how we can update this 
list = ["abc" ] 

list.push("dfghj)
but in the super powerful varriable is when ever this varriable update first we created use sated gived default values supoose we need update value of resturent
i will not modify directly  we will to sign  but i will use setListOfResturent method to updated  what ever need to update supoose need to update resturent empty
how would i do that setListOfResturent([]) now emptythis will make resturent empty this is equal to list = []

now how you can use this varriable use varriable normaly it behave like a normal varriable 
if we give one data our component is rendered  it works just like normal varriable

listOfResturent is normal varriable if i will update it my ui will not update

if we have super powerful varriable keep the ui sic the varriable

if i click filter button it automatically refresh button 

this is known as render

when ever a state varriable updtes rerenders the component
when ever a state changes react will rerenders rerender the component

whats rerender ?
when i click filter button changing the state and react is rerender my component

this body component as soon as list of component updates from any where the st when ever anywher setListOfResturent called react will remove this body and update it properly 
this is the power of the react this is the power of state varriable

when ever a state varriable updates react will rerender my component thats called super powerful state varriable local sate varriable📍📍📍📍❗❗
this is sate varriable

so now we have passs our mocdata resList how to pass this

    const [listOfResturent, setListOfResturent] = useState(resList)
 like this waay

 react will super power dom operation and efficient 
 the logic of updating ui is called rerendering 
 this is super power of react

 react uses Reconciliation Algoritham  is also known as react fiber ❗❗❗ 

 Reconciliation how it does on the ui supoose we have dom dom is like a tree supoose this have res container 
 this retaurent have 15 resturent cards over here so now now what will happend is there is 7 cards my ui filtering cards in 3 filtered cards 
 now supoose my changes what rect changes what reap faster i will tell you 

 when ever you have rect there is virtual dom 

 i will tell whats virtual dom   

 virtual dom is not an actual dom what is actual dom actual dom are tags <div>......<div>
 virtual dom is representation of actual dom 
 vrtual dom is basically object
 virtual dom is actual virtual dom 

 console.log(<body>) -------- this is virtual dom

 virtual dom is normal js object virtual dom is not actual dom its representation 


 what is Diff Algoritham ❗❗📍

 diff Algoritham basically finds out difrence between two virtual dom
 eg : the Restaurantcard have 7 cards  the diff algoritham will find out the diffrence between i click the button on the ui 
 it basicall try to finds out diffrence between old virtual dom and new virtual dom what will be the diffrence of 4 notes  and what it will do insideit will do calculate the diffrence automatically update the dom
 on every render cycle 

 when over we change its reconcilation  
 in React-16 new algoritham to update the dom after react-16 came out react fiber
 the react fiber is new way of findig div and updating the dom

 ultimatly virtual dom is an object  assume that diff alogitham will do  find out the diffrence between it a divone object old object and new object 
 once find 2 object  then it will update the actual dom th at how react is faster

 finding two object js is fast so finds out it will two objwct 

 what ever this ui react will track all ui all the dom virtual dom\
 whts virtual do its a kind of object representation

 if we click filter button new object will form and reat will find diffrence between there is 15 resturent now there are 7 Restaurant when it findout diffrence i object
 then it will  actually update dom

 it doesnot find out any diffrence then not 1
