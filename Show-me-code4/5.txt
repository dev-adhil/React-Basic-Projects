Today we will firstof all clean our app we created lot of mess last time

we created App.js and there lot of components header components resturent card components and body component every thing in to single file and our app.js like almost 2000 lines 

the best practice is seperate foles in seperate components today we will restructure our code we will wrote ever whole code app in app.js we will have multiple files

we restructure our code we will not write whole in app.js we create seeperate files so we will break code multiple files 

first of lets learn folder structure

first of all we write  root level project we writed everything started like scratch in hello react project 

lets now restructure our project liitle now 
generally there very good itention in industry 

All the main code react project we generally keep it src folder
if you are  a developer there will definitly src file 
so we create src folder put app.js file inside of src folder 

all the componentinside my src file

lets clean our src file right ‚ùó

importent every component keep seperate file for every component its good thing 

if our project 1000 of component we doing all app.js single file its bad so we do seperate files in components 
we need a structure pur way 
its not manditory create sperperate no its not manditory but also its our choice what folder structure we do have
some ppls catogorise based on features may we can all the file related to restro its ne file  all the files related to search its search folder like this way
now here our  code 

create component folder 
App.js there is fll of component so what we do seperate it inside component folder

if you need learn folder stucture search ggl write react folder structure there is blog in react

here our project
first create a file header.js
when ever you create a component try to name exactly like the name of the component 
here we creating Header.js and 
every time the first letter capital‚ùó
in the component file one more file Body.js we know it will Body component 
lets move our code now

also also industrial thing is

some ppls also name their file .jsx 
what shouls we follow 
i personally like .js
if u jsx then use jsx file it doesnot a matter dont over think

come project

now we can put header component in to header.js file
what we doing header component is using inside of App.js file 
now react throw an error not find file  ReffrenceEror: Header is not defined 
what we do is we will to import  the header component from file to our main file where we using it 
we import header componet over here the App.js file
‚ùó before i need to import but i need export it 

let me tell you how to export it 
we use normal keyword export and we write default and the name of the component

There are Two ways we can export other way latter 
now we use this way export default Header;
now exported so now we can import that file 
first export then import its a advice first give then take

so now we can import
import Haeder from "./components/Header";
dont forgot look after import file there is .js is there or not if not then add .js
import Haeder from "./components/Header.js";
now ok

similiarly this same thing we doing body component

now we creating a file resturent card in component file and doing similier thing
where we importing RestaurentCard we are not using RestaurentCard where we using import there 
i am using RestaurentCard in Body component file

now we running our code showing a error‚ùó
ReffrenceError: resList is not defined 

so where we using resList in body component file
where is coming from thats that component file not know

we can see resList is there App.js file

one thing we can move this file to Body.js file but
This is not a good way‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó

when ever you have any hard code data resList is hard coded data 
i will teach you good practice

never ever keep a hard coded data in your component folder one more thing we hard coded  ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
one more thing we hard coded there whats that img url there the 
                <img
        className="res-logo"
        alt="res-logo"
        src={
          "https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/" +
          cloudinaryImageId
        }
      />

the url also a hard coded thing this cdn link when ever any hard code code component dont keept there component file 
and one more place we use a logo also 
never ever keep hard coded thing in component files 

so where should we use ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
the common practice is to keep it seperate file that known as constant.js some ppls config.js some ppls utils.js like that
so common use is 
create folder utils utility file
the logo we can use any where in the app

so inside constants.js we create a file config 
this all not manitory but this all good practice

let we learn good practice industry 
util inside create a file constants.js why we not give first letter capital becuse it was not a component

do now move all that in the constants.js file

 its a good habit all the name capital letters with sneakers 
 like const CDN_URL = "", const LOGO_URL="" 

 now there constants.js file there CDN_URL and LOGO_URL what we do this


 we resList change to util inside create a file mockData.js 
 util folder inside two files why we call util its utility we can use evry where 


 now we will use this things

 so firstof all  lrt me tell you mock data where we have use this inside the body

 if u run project lets see error 
 ReffrenceEror: resList is not defined

 so now lets import resList from mockData.js file 
 how we import this before the import its export it and we can import body 

 now i want to tell one thing ‚ùó‚ùó

 one way exporting data is 
 export default resList; like this this is known as default export

 2 ways export 
    1 - default export
    2 - named export

the second way export is use generally we have to export multiple things

in the constant.js there is 2 thing need export

in 1 file have only one default export
so we cant export two export i single file 

what u mean by default export if some one my constant have default has a default export of some thing that mean by defaultthe const file export something
by default my header file exports header file similiarly a one file export one thing 
supoose we have multipple things how do you do thats

thats named export then we use something thats named export

how to do that its very you can write const name front like export const CDN_URL, export const LOGO_URL this way

this is how export multiple things in same file you will always use named export‚ùó‚ùó

so once we have use named export how to import?‚ùó
when we import a slight diffrence in importing 

so when ever you have your named export you have to write curlybraces {} and what ever you want to import this is how you import named export from your file
like this importing :
                        import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/constants"; 
                        and the src or usig place also  a curly braces 
                                src={ 
                                    CDN_URL + cloudinaryImageId
                                }
this is how import named export file 

Two types of Export/import

üìçDefault Export/Import

export default component or varriable;
import component from "path";

üìçNamed Export/Import

export const component;
importent {component} from "path
