Today we will firstof all clean our app we created lot of mess last time

we created App.js and there lot of components header components resturent card components and body component every thing in to single file and our app.js like almost 2000 lines 

the best practice is seperate foles in seperate components today we will restructure our code we will wrote ever whole code app in app.js we will have multiple files

we restructure our code we will not write whole in app.js we create seeperate files so we will break code multiple files 

first of lets learn folder structure

first of all we write  root level project we writed everything started like scratch in hello react project 

lets now restructure our project liitle now 
generally there very good itention in industry 

All the main code react project we generally keep it src folder
if you are  a developer there will definitly src file 
so we create src folder put app.js file inside of src folder 

all the componentinside my src file

lets clean our src file right ‚ùó

importent every component keep seperate file for every component its good thing 

if our project 1000 of component we doing all app.js single file its bad so we do seperate files in components 
we need a structure pur way 
its not manditory create sperperate no its not manditory but also its our choice what folder structure we do have
some ppls catogorise based on features may we can all the file related to restro its ne file  all the files related to search its search folder like this way
now here our  code 

create component folder 
App.js there is fll of component so what we do seperate it inside component folder

if you need learn folder stucture search ggl write react folder structure there is blog in react
