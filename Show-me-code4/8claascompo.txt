import React from "react"

class UserClass extends React.Component {
    render() {
        <div>asdf</div>
    }
}

class base component is a class which extend react based component and it has render method which have return jsx
The only major difrrence is here is render method some piece of jsx and this is the jsx which will to be renderd covert htm to web page 

React component coming from react raect package 

My question is how we should pass props inside this functional component

in the class we have props recivening using constructor 
and constructor have super(props)
