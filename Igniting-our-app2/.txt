two types of dependency in react
        1-dev dependance 2- normal dependancy

        dev dependency is development when we development a app then we use dev dependancy
        normal dependancy using production also

        parcel is bundler 

        so here we pacerl we use dev dependancy

        npm install -D parcel

what is caret and tilde in package.json

        In package.json, the tilde (~) and caret (^) symbols are used to specify the version range for dependencies,
        controlling how updates are handled when you run npm install or yarn install.
        Tilde allows only the patch version upgrades avoiding the minor updates while caret allows updates to patch as well as minor versions.

        caret (^) ith ittal authomatically versions update aavum eg:"parcel": "^2.14.4"

what is package-lock.json and package.json

        package.json its a configuration for our npm  
        it keeps track of what version of the package it install to our system

        when we did npm install parcel what happends was it will went to the production it took some times what they doing fetchng all the code of parcel and putting in to the inside node modules
        node modules kind of data base contains the actual data
        we know package.json its a configuration for our npm  the node modules such like a data base it contains the actual data of that dependencies of those packages of that project
